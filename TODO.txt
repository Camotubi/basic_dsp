2. Think about: Complex and real vectors, f32 and f64 based vectors
3. Think about time and frequency domain
4. Think about some lazyness: Only guarantee calculation if the data result
	is requested from the caller.
	This might be necessary if the vector has been moved to the GPU

9. More basic functions:
- Sqrt
- Real <-> complex conversions
- Phase/Angle
- Unwrap
- Exp, Power
- Log, Log10
- Wrap
- Complex Conj
- Zero Insertion (useful for real -> complex conversion too)
- Differential, Cummulative Sum or Integrate
- FFT/IFFT
- Correlation
- Convolve
- Resample based on convolve
- Window functions
...
10. Think about more domain specfic functions such as frequency estimation
