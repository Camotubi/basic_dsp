Basic digital signal processing (DSP) operations

The basic building blocks are 1xN (one times N) or Nx1 real or compelex vectors where N is typically at least in the order of magnitude of a couple of thousand elements. This crate tries to balance between a clear API and performance.
This project started as small pet project to learn more about DSP, CPU architecture and Rust. Since learning involves making mistakes, don't expect things to be flawless or even close to flawless.
